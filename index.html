    <p>Hi, this is Jahid Hasan. I've completed a long time of training from <a target="-blank" href="https://eshikhon.com/all-courses/">Eshikhon.com</a> on total Digital Marketing and attended many practical projects. I can promote any business, product, or service to millions of people worldwide. I can create effective and attractive web content to promote any business. I can work with full responsibility for a large organization. I am able to work with self-direction and motivation. <br>Also, I have done many projects. Even if, I have many demos or proof sheets on Google drive. All the work is done manually. I love to work with a lot of attention. This is my full-time profession. So here I want to see it as a career that works well.
